A simple C++ implementation of a priority queue backed by a heap-sorted array.

Dependencies
------------
The project depends on C++11. GCC 4.8+ is recommended.

Build
-----
I've included the makefile Eclipse generated for me. It is in the `Default` folder.
You should be able to build it with:

    make -f makefile
